            If so, Congratulations! You've reached the end of my Easy challenges for Linq's .Where() method.

            Do you have any ideas for more methods/tests? Feel free to make up your own tests/methods.
            I'm also welcome to receiving PR contributions that follow the same flow as the rest of this project (across all branches).
            
            Thank you for taking the time to use my repository,
