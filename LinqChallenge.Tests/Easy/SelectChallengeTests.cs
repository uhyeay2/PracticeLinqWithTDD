        /* Instructions can be found in LinqChallenge.Tests project, Easy Folder, WhereChallengeTests.cs if you are just starting the project.

        Here are some tips to keep in mind if you are working on creating your first test.

        1) Recommended Test Names can be found in the Easy.SelectChallenge class.

        2) I recommend starting the name of your Test Method with the name of the method you are testing.

        3) You should only assert one thing per test.

        4) Write one test at a time, and write them before you write the logic needed to pass the method.

        5) If you find yourself initializing the same class in every test, perhaps you can initialize it as a property of the class
                - private readonly SelectChallenge _challenge = new SelectChallenge();
                - If you're unsure what this means, take a peek at my repo to see how I re-use the same instance of the Challenge classes.
